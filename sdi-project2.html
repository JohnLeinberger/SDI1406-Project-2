<p>I've recently been really into survival games and I thought I would do my own take on one. In most games you are required to eat, drink, sleep and assess threats to your physical well being. In this little story you must do all of that. While there is no true survival issues as is, in the next iteration I hope to be able to add these elements to the story.</p>
